Hello, and welcome to the FIS Compliance Suite Supervision Compliance Manager, better known as SCM, product training series. This is session number one. It's an introduction and overview of the training series. So what is the series objective? This series was put together to help you, as a new FIS SCM user or administrator, better understand and thereby leverage the system through providing you a series of topic-specific training videos. Who is the trainer? That's me, Jim McFarland. I've been 25 years in the securities industry, 15 years as a former compliance manager and SCM administrator, and now I work with FIS as a system product analyst. This series was actually launched in the summer of 2023, but based on demand, we actually added additional courses in the fall of 23, as well as the summer of 24. So what is the structure of this series? We're trying to actually keep these to be fairly short. We're targeting between 5 to 15 minutes per session. The sessions are theme-based, each module focusing in on a unique or specific topic. The sessions include both slides, like we're looking at today, as well as, whenever possible, live demonstrations from FIS's demo environment. Whenever possible, we'll also provide in this series additional references to SCM training materials to support your education. The initial training topics have actually been selected by the most common questions we get from new users and new admins. And FIS anticipates continuing to build out this curriculum to cover additional topics based on client feedback. So let's look at the overview of these sessions. So the first four sessions are introductory sessions. These are great, especially if you're brand new to SCM yourself or you've got someone new on your team and you want to give them an overview of what SCM does. So this number one session is the introductory training session. We then have a session about the overall platform, another session that talks about core modules, and then another session that talks about core functionality. Those are the introductory series. Then with series number five, we start to get a little bit more in-depth. So we cover topics such as alert management, case management. We go into the summary and detailed screens. We also talk about products and security information in the tool. We also cover some of the most commonly used baseline reports as well as workflow functionality. From there, we actually go into kind of a more targeted series. These are typically for system admins. Of course, anyone is welcome to listen to these, but these are definitely targeted toward the system admins. These include the user roles and entitlements, organizational hierarchy, the data domains and where data is being pulled in, how the data is provisioned in the system, and system administration and best practices. Finally, we start to get into some specific topics. These are often based on specific questions that come in from the field asking for more information. So starting with session 16, we talk about layouts and filters. We also have a whole series on the mutual fund alerts. These are primarily related to brokerage, but again, can also be related to advisory. We've got composition alerts. That's a little bit more advisory-based, looking at alerts that look at an account's composition. We also have a session on alert testing strategies. We also then have one on auto-letter functionality. That's a little bit more geared toward system admins, but again, anyone is welcome to listen in. We have one on account rank strategies and best practices. And then our two newest modules are on the AML module and its strategies. That session is really geared toward AML teams. And then finally, our most recent one is transaction codes, what you need to know about transaction codes and the system. As you're a new learner, or maybe you're even more of an advanced learner, and you want to build a library, if you will, of knowledge, this video series is a great place to start. But also be aware that with your version, there are PDFs or user guides that can be extremely helpful to have as far as an electronic copy or reference. These include a brochure manager, which is more high level, but then we even have a system admin and a user guide and a compliance manager. So whatever version you're on, if you don't have these, I really recommend that you reach out to your CX support person and ask if you could get a copy of these for your personal library as it relates to your particular version. So that's it. That's session one. Hope to have you dive into the other sessions. And again, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me, Jim McFarland, or your CX support personnel, and hope to see you in future sessions. Thanks so much.
