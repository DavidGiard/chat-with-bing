Hello, and welcome back to the FIS Compliance Suite SCM product training series. You are attending session number three. This is an introduction to the SCM core modules. So in this, there are seven core modules that we'd like to introduce you to today. They include trade review, account periodic, account rank, rep rank, portfolio periodic, portfolio rank, and the AML module. Let's start with the trade module. And in the dropdown on the right, you'll see it listed as trade summary. So the scope of this particular module is trading and trading activity. So it is trade activity. It is run, it runs daily and is probably one of the most popular modules amongst our clients. Its feature includes, it's very timely in that you're typically looking at trades either one to two days after they take place. And the focus of these particular alerts is usually on a trade specific aspect, such as concentration, missed break points, firm wide trading restrictions, OTC bulletin board training, employee client trading, just to name a few of the topics. The next module is the account periodic module. This one is all about account activity, which could include trades and other activities such as deposits or journals. The alerts allow a reviewer to look at a single aspect within the account. For example, maybe concentration. The frequency is a big benefit here because it's user elected. You can determine or your firm can determine how frequently you want these alerts to run. You can set things for daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even for an annual review. And it's the second most popular module that we have being used by our clients. Again, the features included allows for a single aspect of a risk review. You can control your frequency and it's a very effective option for managing accounts or monitoring accounts for an individual risk. And the one unique element of account periodic versus trade review is allows for suppression. So once a review has been completed, it does allow a supervisor to suppress that account and that risk for a certain period of time. Now we move into the account rank module, which is one of my favorites. The account rank module is looking at risks, both a single risk or multiple risks together. It is automatically set up for a frequency of monthly and it includes, it does support suppression, similar to what I mentioned in the account periodic module. And what's really powerful in this particular module is you can actually combine alerts. So you're not looking at a single risk aspect, you're looking at multiple. For example, maybe combine commission velocity with turnover to identify potential churning. And it also helps supervisors see an account trending over time. So when accounts do trigger, you can actually go back and see what the prior comments are as well as the history on that account for the last 13 months. The next module is rep rank. And this is new within the last five years or so. So rep rank is all about looking at a rep's book of business. It's a high level view. And it looks across their business on a monthly basis. It includes a holistic review of their client's accounts. For example, if you've got a rep that's maybe concentrated in a particular sector or industry, rep rank would help you identify that. And it also includes information about joint or shared reps as well. Then we have the portfolio periodic modules. These are brand new in the last five years as well. They include things like alerts that allow for a portfolio to look for a single risk. For example, maybe portfolios that are concentrated in the energy sector. It does allow a firm to determine the frequency of the review. Maybe there are some portfolio aspects that you wanna look at daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, et cetera. And it does allow for both a single aspect. You can control the frequency of it. And it's the best option for looking at portfolios for an individual risk such as concentration. And it also again allows the user to figure out once they've done the review, how long they want to suppress that portfolio before it comes up again. And one of the critical elements here is for the portfolio modules is to make sure that you're sending us portfolio information. That could either be tax information or it could also include, for example, a special portfolio ID. Portfolio rank is very similar. I call them sister modules. So same thing. Again, the big difference between these two is with the portfolio rank is you're usually looking at portfolios from multiple levels of risks, concentration and losses, age suitability, things like that where again, you're looking across multiple portfolios to say at a rep level something or at a portfolio level, something seems to be a mess. And then finally, there are clients that use effectively our AML module. This is all about alerts for a single or multiple risk aspect. The AML modules run daily and they focus on AML topics such as cash activity, wired journals, foreign activity, all of those. So that's it. That's a really high level of what you're going to be encountering here in the training session. We hope to have you join us on future sessions and thanks for attending.
