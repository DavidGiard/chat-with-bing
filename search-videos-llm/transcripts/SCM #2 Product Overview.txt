Hello, and welcome back to the FIS Compliance Suite SCM product training series. You are attending session number two, which is an introduction to SCM for new users. So what is FIS Supervision Compliance Manager or SCM? FIS Supervision Compliance Manager is an intuitive, automated trade monitoring, surveillance, and sales supervision system. The system is designed to help you as a firm to detect, document, and help remediate potential regulatory violations within your trading platforms. SCM is a premier solution for surveillance of firms' trades, accounts, and rep information according to regulatory and firm-defined guidelines. And as regulatory agencies continue to issue new requirements, the solution incorporates new rules to help firms mitigate internal and regulatory risks related to these new regulatory items. Now what you may not know is SCM is actually part of a suite of three different product offerings. So you have Supervision Compliance Manager, the product that you're learning about today, but there are two sister applications. And SCM, of course, focuses on trades, accounts, and rep monitoring, but its sister application, ECM, is focused on employee activity, such as pre-approvals and outside activities. And the third leg of this duel is CCM, which is Communications Compliance Manager, which looks at e-communications monitoring and social media. So what are some of the primary functions of the SCM software? Well, the main group of activity is related to trade monitoring. So we're looking for trade-related risks such as trades resulting in a concentrated position or employee-client trading activity, trade-related suitability concerns by product type or client demographics, trades flagged for mutual fund breakpoint concerns. Next, we also have account-related risks, such as excessive trading in an account, possible improper use of discretion in an account, inactivity or low activity advisory counts, unusual losses within an account, account composition concerns, for example, standard deviation or asset allocation. And then we also have AML-related risks that the software can monitor for. These include atypical wires or journals, wash transactions, or activity related to foreign accounts. In addition, the recent subscriptions also include monitoring at rep levels and portfolio levels covering some of the same topics. So what is the product's history? The product actually was launched back in 2000, and it was launched as Protigent Broker Audit. The company was founded by two experienced compliance officers in Boston, Massachusetts. The software was originally referred to as ProServe. Sometimes you'll even hear that in conferences or in conversations with other clients. In 2005, Protigent was acquired by SunGuard Online Investment Services. SunGuard then was acquired in 2015 by Fidelity National Information Services, or FIS, who is the current owner of the product. The product was rebranded under the name Supervision Compliance Manager in 2021. So what types of firms use this product? Well, our clients include national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, banks that have security offerings, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, registered investment advisors, and what roles or individuals within a firm would often use this product. Those could include registered reps and their field sales teams, branch or regional field managers, business supervision teams, compliance departments, internal audit departments, and regulatory response departments. Finally, there's also the system administrators, who is likely you, attending this session. What does FIS do to keep the product current and relevant? Well, most importantly, we seek active client feedback. This can come in the form of network calls, user and focus groups, and annual conferences. We also are actively monitoring regulatory actions and notifications via the websites. FIS actively monitors SEC, FINRA, and other regulatory sources for news releases, finds, and findings that we can learn from and potentially create new rules to help manage these risks. What other resources are available to a system user? Well, if you're trying to learn about the system, you can always obtain release notes. Also, there are user guides available, product-related white papers, and user network calls and peer group participation. So that's it for session two. Hope to have you join us in session three and beyond. Thanks for attending today.
