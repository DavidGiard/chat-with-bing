Hello, and welcome back to the FIS Compliance Suite Supervision Compliance Manager, better known as SCM, product training series. This is session number 12. This session is going to focus on organizational hierarchy. So before we get into the slides, here are some things about organizational hierarchy that you would want to know before you actually look at the detail. First of all, most firms actually have groups. So if you think about their overall structure, firms may have several different businesses and each of those businesses has a unique hierarchy associated with it. So the highest level would be groups. Then within the tool, you'll also see the ability to view an overview. So this is a good way to just see if things are aligned and pointed in the right direction. Then all of you would probably have registered reps. These are the individuals that are doing business in your instance, whose trades and activities are being monitored. Then you have different unit types. Often these are associated with branches or locations, but they can vary. Then you actually have physical units. These are typically branches and how they're structured. Then you actually have the users that are in the tool using the tool. So when it comes to organizational hierarchy, let's go ahead and actually start at the top of the tree. So for me, if I go in here to admin and here's my hierarchy elections, I'm actually going to go down first to the very bottom for groups. So groups will show you if you have a multi-firm type structure. If you're listening to this recording, most likely you're already set up and running, and this is simply you kind of learning more about how your firm is structured and how your flows take place. You're not necessarily having to build anything from scratch. All of this should have been done during your implementation, but this is where you can begin to view, understand, and maybe make corrections to how things flow. So the top of the house are the groups. The next level, after you've looked at the groups, if that looks to be fine, then you might want to go in to do an overview. And an overview is, I think of it more of almost as a geographic overview where I can go in and see my different regions and my branches and how they flow in. You'll also know that each branch has a code associated with it. Maybe it's alpha characters or an alphanumeric, but you have all of these. So all of your physical locations, your branches could roll up into a complex and a complex could roll up into a region and a region can roll up into a division. Again, every firm structure is a little bit different, but this is where you can kind of see and confirm to say, yep, that looks right. I've got the right number of branches, they're in the right locations, which again, all feeds into making sure your supervisors, when they're supervising the reps, are supervising the correct reps because those reps will actually be assigned to certain branches. So the next level then is we've gone from groups to overview. I would think the next would be unit types. So what types of units do you have out there? This kind of goes back to your groups again to say, you've got maybe a company and firms and sub firms and regions and branches. This will be unique to your particular firm, but you'll see them listed here. You'll see a unit type code, and you'll also see a unit order, which you can confirm via the screen. Then you go from that to the actual units themselves. So here is the units. Now, again, as we move our way down the tree, more and more branches, we'll see a lot more activity. So now if I actually extend this to 250, you're going to see all the different structures here where we've got these unique unit ID identifications. And again, maybe these are regions. So this is our west region or our mountain region, and as we go down, we'll actually see branches. So this is all about the geographic hierarchy of your firm and how things are being reported in. The next level, as we continue to move down, is going to actually be reps. So your reps all should have a unique rep code, and they're going to have a name. It'll also be whether they're active or they're inactive. You'll see that here. You can actually go in and take a quick peek, see what they're being assigned to, all of their status. These codes are critical because this is what then is in turn assigned to the branches, which then rolls up to your supervisors. So all of these rep IDs, every rep should have an ID, a single unique ID, but then also someone that may be associated with joint IDs as well. And so we go from reps to rep codes, and then finally, the bottom rung of our ladder here is users. So the users are the ones that are actually logging into the system. You'll see that they actually have unique user keys. You cannot go into SCM to view or see anything without a user ID. All of them have to be enabled, and this is where you can see all of your different users that are out there. And if you needed to, if you want to get some more information about what they look like or what their profile is, you can hit this edit button and you're going to see that information as far as cell, email. You may have a default role there. Sometimes you don't, it depends on your firm structure, but you will see these unique user keys. And if I cancel, and then if I go to the next one over, there's even more detailed information as it relates to that user. And again, some of this stuff is optional depending on your structure, email addresses, phone numbers, insurance appointments. All of this depends on your particular subscription level and how you want to manage it. But there can be a lot of information here if you choose to. The one thing I forgot to mention that I need to go back just really quickly with is back on the units is as we're looking at these units, if we go to some of these branches, if I click into the detail of the branches, this is where you would actually then see the rep assignment. So, you know, each branch is going to have rep codes that are associated with them. And these in turn feed all of the trade information into the supervisory module. So your hierarchy is really critical. I know a lot of time and energy getting it set up right, maybe tweaking it once in a while. But once it runs, it should run pretty efficiently. And again, it provides the benefit of getting the right trades and the right reps in front of the right supervisors. So that completes session 12 on organizational hierarchy. I hope you found that helpful. If you have additional questions, you can always refer to any of your administration guides from SCM, user guides, administration guides will have hierarchy information in there and your FIS support person can provide additional information as well. Thanks for joining us and hope to see you on future training sessions.
