Hello, and welcome to the FIS Compliance Suite Supervision Compliance Manager, better known as SCM, product training series. This is session number 13. This session is going to focus on data domains. So as we talk about data domains, what are data domains? And by the way, on these particular training sessions, both 13 and 14, I don't have a lot of visuals to show you because this is really basically how the information is collected and aggregated behind the scenes. So you'll have to kind of bear with me as we go through some slides to give you an overview on this. So data domains are the categories of information that are required by SCM to support your supervisory activity within the system. And data domains, when we're looking for data from you or your providers, really fall under five primary categories. So the first category is what I'm going to call business type data. The second one would be product or security data. The third element is account holder and relationships information or data related to those. The fourth one is systems data. And then the fifth one is kind of a miscellaneous or other category. So I'm going to go through all five of these and just give you some examples of the type of data that we're looking for in order to support your instance. So let's go ahead and start with the business data. So the business data is usually, especially if you're using the trade module, that's pretty straightforward. It includes things like trade information, you know, all the trade, you know, when was the trade? What was the security? Things like that. It also though includes activity. So do remember that with SCM, it's not just about trading, but it could be activities like journals or wires for our AML modules, et cetera. So you've got trade activity, trading and activity. You also have account information. So this is where we get the profile of the account and the account that's there. So positions, what that account holds. And more recently in the last five or six years with positions, we've also expanded that to include cost basis on those positions. And then finally balances, money markets, things like that. So this is the type of business data that we are collecting every night through your feeds in order to support the instance. Then the second category is more product or security type data. So this includes things like product types or subtypes with, for example, mutual funds and all the different share classes or UITs or ETFs. I mean, there's literally a hundred or so different product types that are out there. And this is again, how the system gathers it at night to collect it and processes it. This would include things like symbols and QSIPs, security numbers are part of these feeds. Also, for example, in fixed income, you'd have maturity dates, bond ratings are another example of product or security data that we're collecting. And then also security subscriptions. And then finally, maybe the trade exchanges. So what exchange was involved for that particular equity that was involved. So these are examples of product or security data that again, each night we are collecting and aggregating and processing. Third category is account holder and relationships data. Now most of you think about when we talk about account holder is an entity, meaning a person, right? So it's an individual, but as you all probably know, it's not just people. It can also be entities such as trusts, corporations, maybe joint accounts, things like that. So entity is one level, but then anti-account is another level. And this is where the system has done some software updates over the last couple of years to meet current regulatory requirements regarding things. For example, who is the account holder? So if it is an institutional account or corporate account, we've got multiple people involved. You need to know who those holders are, who the beneficial owners are. For example, a trust, who's the trustee versus who's the beneficiary. And then maybe percent ownership, who's got controlling interest, et cetera. So with regulatory, raising the bar as far as understanding accounts and their relationships and beneficial owners, we have expanded our software to include those types of feeds, if that's something that you're able to provide us. And then finally, portfolios. So this has been something really popular in the last 10 years is what are the relationships from a portfolio standpoint. So this is where we look to your firm to feed us to say, hey, these accounts we want to treat as a portfolio. And maybe we're looking at that from a concentration level or an activity level, et cetera. So that's not, again, part of this account holder and relationships data that we are receiving from your firm. Then we get into systems data. So a great example in systems data is hierarchy data. And if you'll remember, or you are going through this series in chronological order, we just talked about that in session 12. So hierarchy is all about your structure, your reps, your branches, your joint reps, et cetera. We require this information in order to process and associate things appropriately to locations or to individuals. It also could be system data for product or security information that may be unique to your firm. Something that is unique where you're sending an indicator and we're incorporating that into our logic. Now, this could be, again, unique client product data information, but more commonly, we're looking for things coming from outside vendors. So this is where we would leverage our relationships with vendors such as Morningstar or Blue Sky Data Corporation to supplement the data with more information on a particular security or class. And then finally, we've got miscellaneous and other data. So that would include, for example, we do have companies that are in the insurance industry and they are sending us information regarding their applications or applicants, individual applicants for insurance policies. And then also we have a couple of clients using another software version of ours that has REGBI information. So again, through a secondary party, they're collecting REGBI activity and transmitting that to us as well. So I know that was pretty high level. We're going to go into session 14 here as well. A little bit more challenging because I don't necessarily have a visual for you on this, but it gives you a sense of the type of data that we're collecting through your feeds and then how we begin to organize that in order to support your instance. So hang tight, definitely go in and join us on session 14 and we'll give you some more insight regarding data domains and data provisioning. So thanks again for attending today.
